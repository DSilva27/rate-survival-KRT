# Transition rates, survival probabilities, and quality of bias from time-dependent biased simulations

Scripts with examples for the estimation of the intrinsic rate (k_o) and the quality of bias (gamma) from time-dependent biased simulations by fitting numerically the cumulative distribution function.

## LIKELIHOOD MAXIMIZATION
In the `LM_KTR` folder, we provide a python script for numerically fitting the maximum bias, and the survival probablity (see README in that folder). The example data is for the 2D system using y-coordinate `(k_unbias=5.6e-8)`.
