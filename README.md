# Transition rates, survival probabilities, and quality of bias from time-dependent biased simulations

Scripts with examples for the estimation of the rate (k) and the quality of bias (gamma) from 
time-dependent biased simulations by fitting analytically or numerically the survival function

## Numerical fit
Example data for the 2D system using y-coordinate `(k_o=5.6e-8)`

## Analytical fit: 
Example data for the CDK2-ligand unbinding `(k_{exp} = 0.26 +/- 0.05s^{-1})`
